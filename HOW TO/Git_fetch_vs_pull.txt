This file was created to understand git opull vs git fetch

Scenario 1:-
Fetch_Vs_Pull.txt file has been added to remote github directly.Thus this file is not present on our local branch.
A file named Git_fetch_vs_pull.txt has been created and I tried pushing this change to remote but below mentioned error occured:-

 
 "! [rejected]        main -> main (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/Abhishekchaudhare/DATACAMP.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details."

This error came as there are some changed in remote that are not present in our local.
Thus we have to have those changes in our local before push changes of local in remote.

--What i did???
-->I did git pull
-->Added a commit comment
-->came to directory base, did git push

Scenario 2:-
I deleted Fetch_Vs_Pull.txt file from remote.
I commited Git_fetch_vs_pull.txt in local and while pushing this change i got the same error again as there are some changes in remote that are not present in our local (i.e deleted Fetch_Vs_Pull.txt file)

-What i did??
-->Git Fetch
-->Observations:-
-Changes that i did in remote are not visible in my local this till now not even in git log.

"$ git status
On branch main
Your branch and 'origin/main' have diverged,
and have 1 and 1 different commits each, respectively.
  (use "git pull" to merge the remote branch into yours)

nothing to commit, working tree clean"


--But i could see the commit at this below location:-
go to /c/Users/abhis/GITHUB/DATACAMP/.git/refs/remotes/origin
do cat main to see the commit of remote 

--git log :- the remote commit is not visible

--i don't know how should i compare changes in staged with working directory?
