This file was created to understand git opull vs git fetch

Scenario:-
Fetch_Vs_Pull.txt file has been added to remote github directly.Thus this file is not present on our local branch.
A file named Git_fetch_vs_pull.txt has been created and I tried pushing this change to remote but below mentioned error occured:-

 
 "! [rejected]        main -> main (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/Abhishekchaudhare/DATACAMP.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details."

This error came as there are some changed in remote that are not present in our local.
Thus we have to have those changes in our local before push changes of local in remote.
