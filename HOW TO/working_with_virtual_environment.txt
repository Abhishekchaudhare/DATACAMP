->Vitual environments helps in freezing dependencies to prevent future breaking of code due to any upgrade.
->There are multiple ways of creating a virtual environment , some are after installing modules like 'virtualenv' and some donot require any installation.
->Here we will work with 'venv' module which is in built.
---------------
Steps:-
python -m venv abhishek_venv
(this will create a folder with the name abhishek_venv and that folder will have lot of files)

To activate virtual environment:-
POSIX
bash/zsh - $ source <venv>/bin/activate
fish - $ source <venv>/bin/activate.fish
csh/tcsh$ - source <venv>/bin/activate.csh
PowerShell Core - $ <venv>/bin/Activate.ps1

Windows
cmd.exe - C:\> <venv>\Scripts\activate.bat
PowerShell - PS C:\> <venv>\Scripts\Activate.ps1

To deactivate:-
deactivate
-------------

->Creating requirement.txt to freeze the dependencies of the project.
pip freeze > requirement.txt
->Using requirement.txt
Go inside the virtual environment and do:
1. pip install -r requirement.txt
?might not be able to install some packages,for now delete them

Creating a virtual envirinment using System settings
python -m venv venv_2 --system-site-packages
